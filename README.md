  I am 21 years old, and I am majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Honors Interdisciplinary Studies from Western Washington University. I am deeply interested in virtual reality and plan to undergo virtual reality research with my department. In my free time I enjoy creating 3D game objects in blender and exploring in virtual reality. I am always on the lookout for new projects to work on and new people to collaborate with.
